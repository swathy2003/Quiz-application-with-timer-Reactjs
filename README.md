# Quiz-application-with-timer-Reactjs
The Quiz Application with Timer - ReactJS is an interactive web-based quiz platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a countdown timer, real-time score tracking, and instant feedback. The project is structured with index.html for layout, style.css for design, script.js for functionality, and question.js for quiz data.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer:** Each question has a built-in timer that counts down, adding an element of pressure for the user.
- **Real-time Score Tracking:** The userâ€™s score is updated as they answer questions correctly, providing instant feedback on their progress.
- **Instant Feedback:** The app immediately provides feedback on whether the user's answer was correct or incorrect, with a visual indicator (green for correct, red for incorrect).
- **Dynamic Question Rendering:** Questions and answers are dynamically rendered from a predefined dataset, making it easy to update the quiz content.
- **User Interface:** A simple, clean, and responsive design ensures a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** Contains the basic structure and layout of the application, serving as the entry point for the quiz.
- **style.css:** Provides styling for the user interface, ensuring the app is visually appealing and responsive.
- **script.js:** Contains the core logic for handling the quiz functionality, including question rendering, timer functionality, score tracking, and user interaction.
- **question.js:** Stores an array of questions, options, and correct answers, which are used to generate the quiz dynamically.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open the project folder** and double-click on **index.html** to open it in your preferred browser. This will launch the quiz application.

3. **Start the Quiz:** Click on the "Start Quiz" button to begin the quiz. The countdown timer will start immediately, and you can answer each question within the given time limit.

## How the Quiz Works

1. The user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, which displays the first question.
2. Each question comes with four answer options, and the user selects an option.
3. The countdown timer starts for each question. If the user answers before the time runs out, their answer is recorded.
4. After the user selects an answer, instant feedback is provided:
   - Correct answers are highlighted in green with a check mark.
   - Incorrect answers are highlighted in red with a cross mark.
5. The user proceeds to the next question, and the process repeats.
6. At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their total score based on the number of correct answers.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the quiz app is simple and effective, there are several potential improvements that can be made:

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels:** Add different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) for users to choose from.
- **Categories:** Allow the user to select quiz categories (e.g., General Knowledge, Science, History) to make the quiz more engaging and varied.
- **Question Database:** Implement a backend system or use an external API to dynamically fetch questions and answers, allowing for an ever-expanding question pool.
- **User Accounts:** Allow users to create accounts to track their scores over time or compete with friends.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Defines the structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS:** Used for styling and ensuring the app is responsive across different devices.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the functionality of the app, including quiz logic, timer, and user interaction.
